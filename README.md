1) It will be within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed since automated tests in a GitHub Action catch bugs immediately after each push, ensuring that broken code doesnâ€™t make it into the main branch.
2) No, E2E tests check the entire application not each individual function
3) Navigation mode analyzes full-page load performance from a fresh start, while snapshot mode inspects the current state of a page without reloading it
